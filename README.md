FRONTEND - MIDDLEEND - BACKEND

- we need intermidiate layer to communicate between client and microservices

- can aslo do message validation , Response tranformation , rate limiting , caching , logging , security , etc
- we try to prepare an API GATEWAY which will be the entry point for all the requests
